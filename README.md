# solar-field-simulator
A stochastic approach to generate and simulate solar field designs

## Background
This code was part of my 2014 master thesis. It is based on the paper [_A conceptual design of solar boiler (2009)_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222729870_A_conceptual_design_of_solar_boiler),
published by some of the professors at the department of energy engineering at the school of industrial engineering (Polytechnical university of Madrid, UPM)
