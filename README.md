# solar-field-simulator
A stochastic approach to generate and simulate solar field designs

## Background
This code was part of my master thesis written back in 2014. It is based on the paper
[_A conceptual design of solar boiler (2009)_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222729870_A_conceptual_design_of_solar_boiler),
published by some of the professors at the department of energy engineering at
the school of industrial engineering (Polytechnical university of Madrid, UPM).

### What is a solar boiler?
It is a concept of solar thermal power plant that aims to recycle the knowledge
of a century using fossil fuel boilers to produce electrical energy,
substituting the conventional fuel totally or partially with solar energy.

## Aim
This project aimed to give an answer to how a solar field that feeds this kind
of power plant should be (number of heliostats, size of the mirrors, size of
the land, performance, heliostat distribution...).
